# This directory holds SSL certificates for production deployment.
# Place your cert.pem and key.pem files here.
#
# To generate self-signed certificates for testing:
#   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#     -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
#     -subj "/CN=localhost"
#
# For production, use Let's Encrypt or your certificate authority.
