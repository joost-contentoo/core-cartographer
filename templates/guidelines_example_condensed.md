# REFERENCE EXAMPLES (showing expected output quality for different contexts)

## Example A: German E-commerce Product Pages

### Voice
PERSONALITY: Knowledgeable, friendly helper - like a tech-savvy friend who gets straight to the point.

TONE MARKERS:
- Confident: States facts directly without hedging ("Du erhältst..." not "Sie könnten erhalten...")
- Helpful: Anticipates questions, provides concrete solutions
- Efficient: Respects reader's time, uses bullet points for scanning
- Reassuring: Emphasizes security without being alarmist

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: Pragmatic and trustworthy - conveys value through facts, not enthusiasm.

AVOID:
- Formal address (Sie, Ihnen, Ihr): Brand uses consistent informal "du"
- Artificial urgency ("Nur noch heute!", "Beeile dich!"): German readers distrust pressure tactics
- Vague superlatives ("Das Beste!", "Einzigartig!"): Lacks credibility without proof

PREFER:
- Concrete benefits: "sofort per E-Mail", "in Sekunden einlösbar"
- Trust signals: "sicher", "offizieller Partner", "geprüft"
- Practical value: "volle Kostenkontrolle", "ohne Kreditkarte"

### Writing Style
PHILOSOPHY: Adaptation over translation. German versions restructure for scannability, add payment/security details German readers expect, condense promotional language.

SENTENCE PREFERENCES:
- Shorter than English source - one idea per sentence
- Front-loaded: Key benefit first, context second
- Active voice with clear subject ("Du erhältst" not "Es wird gesendet")

STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Questions as openers: "Möchtest du...? Dann bist du hier richtig!"
- Numbered steps for instructions, ending with "Fertig!" for closure
- Bullet points for benefits (Vorteile) - each standalone statement

CONTENT TYPE ADJUSTMENTS:
- Product pages: Security-focused, emphasize privacy and payment options
- FAQ content: Direct answers first, then context

### Cultural Adaptation
TARGET AUDIENCE VALUES:
- Privacy/data protection: "Ohne Weitergabe deiner Bankdaten"
- Cost transparency: Specific fees with euro examples, not vague "fees may apply"
- Practicality: Concrete "how it works" over emotional "why you'll love it"

MARKET-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- Payment methods: Prioritize PayPal, Klarna, Sofortüberweisung (credit cards less common)
- Trust markers: "Offizieller Partner", customer service availability

LOCALIZATION NOTES:
- Currency: "5 €" (number + space + symbol)
- Decimals: comma not period (2,50 not 2.50)
- Keep English product names, hyphenate compounds (Xbox-Guthaben)

## Example B: French Premium Beauty Brand Pages

### Voice
PERSONALITY: Refined expert sharing secrets - knowledgeable yet approachable, never condescending.

TONE MARKERS:
- Elegant: Sophisticated vocabulary, flowing sentences
- Authoritative: Speaks from expertise, references heritage and research
- Sensory: Evokes textures, scents, experiences
- Aspirational: Invites reader into a world of quality

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: Quietly confident luxury - suggests exclusivity without overt boasting.

AVOID:
- Informal address (tu): Premium French brands maintain "vous" for sophistication
- Hard selling ("Achetez maintenant!"): Undermines luxury positioning
- Technical jargon without context: Explain innovations elegantly

PREFER:
- Sensory language: "texture soyeuse", "parfum délicat", "sensation de confort"
- Heritage references: "savoir-faire", "depuis 1952", "nos laboratoires"
- Invitation not command: "Découvrez" rather than "Essayez"

### Writing Style
PHILOSOPHY: Transcreation for emotional resonance. French copy is often longer, more elaborate - this is expected and appreciated for premium brands.

SENTENCE PREFERENCES:
- Longer, flowing sentences acceptable for brand storytelling
- Passive voice for scientific claims ("formulé pour", "testé sous contrôle")
- Build to the benefit rather than leading with it

STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Open with sensory or emotional hook
- Layer details: experience → science → results
- Close with invitation to discover more

CONTENT TYPE ADJUSTMENTS:
- Brand pages: Storytelling, heritage, emotional connection
- Product pages: Sensory benefits first, ingredients/science second

### Cultural Adaptation
TARGET AUDIENCE VALUES:
- Quality and craftsmanship: "formulé en France", ingredient sourcing stories
- Expertise: Clinical results, dermatologist mentions, research references
- Sensorial pleasure: The experience of using the product, not just results

MARKET-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- French pharmacie culture: Reference to "parapharmacie" adds credibility
- Skincare routine: French readers expect régime/routine guidance

LOCALIZATION NOTES:
- Maintain French product names where they exist
- Percentage claims: "95% des femmes" (comma for thousands: 1 000)
- Times: 24h format, "matin et soir"

## Example C: Dutch SaaS Blog Content

### Voice
PERSONALITY: Smart colleague sharing insights - direct, practical, no pretense.

TONE MARKERS:
- Direct: Gets to the point immediately, no fluff
- Pragmatic: Focuses on "what works" over theory
- Informal: Conversational, uses "je" throughout
- Honest: Acknowledges limitations, avoids overselling

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: Confident but understated - lets value speak for itself.

AVOID:
- Formal address (u): Feels distant and outdated for modern Dutch business
- Hyperbole ("revolutionair", "baanbrekend"): Dutch readers are skeptical
- Excessive enthusiasm: Multiple exclamation marks feel unprofessional

PREFER:
- Concrete examples: Specific numbers, real scenarios
- Directness: "Dit werkt omdat..." rather than building suspense
- Practical takeaways: "Wat je hieraan hebt" sections

### Writing Style
PHILOSOPHY: Functional adaptation. Dutch is naturally direct - don't add padding that English source might have. Shorter is better.

SENTENCE PREFERENCES:
- Short, punchy sentences for main points
- One clear takeaway per paragraph
- Active voice strongly preferred ("je ziet" not "er wordt getoond")

STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Lead with the insight or conclusion
- Use headers as complete thoughts, not teasers
- End sections with actionable next step

CONTENT TYPE ADJUSTMENTS:
- Blog posts: Personal, include writer's perspective
- Product updates: Bullet-point focused, link to details

### Cultural Adaptation
TARGET AUDIENCE VALUES:
- Time efficiency: Dense information, scannable format
- Honesty: Acknowledge trade-offs, avoid marketing speak
- Practicality: "How does this help me today?"

MARKET-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- English terms often kept: "feedback", "software", "app" (don't force Dutch)
- Dutch business culture: Flat hierarchy reflected in direct communication

LOCALIZATION NOTES:
- Currency: "€ 5" or "5 euro" (both acceptable)
- English loanwords: Keep if commonly used, no need to explain
- Humor: Light self-deprecation acceptable, not common in English B2B

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: Measured confidence - lets evidence build the case.

AVOID:

PREFER:
- Data-led statements: "El 73% de los encuestados indica..."
- Clear structure words: "En primer lugar", "Por otro lado", "En conclusión"
- Practical implications: "Esto significa que las empresas pueden..."

### Writing Style
PHILOSOPHY: Professional adaptation. Spanish B2B accepts longer, more elaborate sentences than English. Provide full context - brevity can seem superficial.

SENTENCE PREFERENCES:
- Longer sentences with clear internal structure
- Subjunctive for recommendations and possibilities
- Formal connectors to show logical flow

STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Executive summary (resumen ejecutivo) at start
- Clear section signposting with headers

- Clear: Simple words, no jargon
- Humble: Features speak for themselves, no boasting
- Supportive: Acknowledges user's goals, helps achieve them

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: Calm competence - "lagom" (just enough), never overselling.

AVOID:
- Any formality markers: Swedish dropped formal "ni" decades ago
- Superlatives ("bäst", "mest kraftfulla"): Feels like empty marketing
- Exclamation marks: One per page maximum, if any

PREFER:
- Simple, everyday words: "få" not "erhålla", "börja" not "initiera"
- Understated benefits: "Det här sparar tid" not "Revolutionera ditt arbete!"
- Helpful framing: "Tips:" "Bra att veta:" "Nästa steg:"

### Writing Style
PHILOSOPHY: Simplification and de-escalation. Swedish UX copy is minimal. Remove anything that doesn't directly help the user.

SENTENCE PREFERENCES:
- As short as possible - fragments acceptable in UI
- Imperative for actions ("Spara", "Välj", "Gå vidare")
- Questions to guide: "Vill du spara ändringarna?"

- Help articles: Step-by-step with screenshots, friendly headers

### Cultural Adaptation
TARGET AUDIENCE VALUES:
- Efficiency: Don't waste user's time with unnecessary words
- Trust through simplicity: Over-explaining suggests hiding something
- Equality: Never talk down to user, assume competence

MARKET-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
- Swedish design culture: Clean, minimal, functional (IKEA principle)
- "Jantelagen" influence: Don't claim to be better than others

LOCALIZATION NOTES:
- No special characters in URLs/slugs (ä→a, ö→o, å→a)
- Time: 24h format (14:00 not 2 PM)
- Currency: "995 kr" or "995 SEK"
