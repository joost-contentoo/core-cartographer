# German Localisation Guidelines for dundle Content

## Purpose

This document provides qualitative guidance for localising English dundle content for the German market. It covers tone, voice, cultural context, and content philosophy. These guidelines apply to ANY product or content type.

For specific terminology, formatting rules, and checklists, refer to the accompanying Glossary document.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Localisation, Not Translation

**German content is an adaptation, not a direct translation.**

The German reader has different expectations, cultural context, and information needs. Successful localisation means:

- **Restructuring** content for German reading preferences (scannability, directness)
- **Adding** market-specific information (fees, regulations, German payment methods)
- **Condensing** where English is verbose, expanding where German readers need detail
- **Adapting** tone to match German digital commerce expectations

> **Key insight:** German versions are typically 10-20% different in structure. Some sections will be shorter (introductions), others longer (fee explanations, step-by-step instructions).

---

## 2. Brand Voice & Personality

### 2.1 Overall Tone

dundle speaks to German customers as a **knowledgeable friend** who understands digital products and online payments. The tone balances:

| Quality | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **Confident** | We know our products; we state facts clearly |
| **Helpful** | We anticipate questions and provide solutions |
| **Direct** | We get to the point; we don't waste time |
| **Reassuring** | We emphasise security without being alarmist |
| **Modern** | We're comfortable with digital; we don't over-explain basics |

### 2.2 Emotional Register

German digital commerce copy tends toward the **pragmatic** rather than the **promotional**.

**Avoid:**
- Excessive enthusiasm ("Amazing!", "Incredible!")
- Hyperbole ("The best ever!")
- Pressure tactics ("Don't miss out!", "Limited time!")

**Instead, convey value through:**
- Clarity about benefits
- Concrete examples
- Practical information
- Trustworthy tone

### 2.3 Tone Transformation Example

**English style:**
> "Looking to top up your account without using a credit card? Buy a gift card and add prepaid credit quickly and securely!"

**German style:**
> "Möchtest du dein Konto aufladen? Bei dundle kaufst du bequem mit PayPal, Klarna Sofortüberweisung oder 15 weiteren Zahlungsarten."

Notice how German:
- Asks a shorter, more direct question
- Names specific payment methods immediately
- Uses "bequem" (convenient) as the key value
- Reduces exclamation-heavy enthusiasm

---

## 3. Writing Style

### 3.1 Address: The "du" Decision

dundle uses **informal "du"** throughout all German content. This is a deliberate brand choice that:

- Creates approachability
- Matches the digital-native audience expectation
- Aligns with modern German e-commerce conventions

**Never mix "du" and "Sie"** within any piece of content. Maintain consistency in all verb conjugations and possessives.

### 3.2 Sentence Structure Preferences

German readers scanning product pages prefer:

- **Shorter sentences** than typical English marketing copy
- **Front-loaded information** (key point first, context second)
- **Active voice** with clear subjects
- **Specific details** over vague promises

**Instead of:**
> "With our amazing service, you can easily and quickly purchase products that will be delivered to your inbox instantly, allowing you to start using them right away!"

**Write:**
> "Bei dundle erhältst du deinen Code sofort per E-Mail. Direkt einlösbar, ohne Wartezeit."

### 3.3 Questions as Openers

German pages frequently use rhetorical questions to open sections:

- "Möchtest du...?" (Do you want to...?)
- "Suchst du...?" (Are you looking for...?)
- "Brauchst du...?" (Do you need...?)

Follow immediately with dundle as the solution. This creates a conversational flow without being pushy.

**Pattern:**
> "Möchtest du [desired outcome]? Dann bist du bei dundle genau richtig!"

### 3.4 Conveying Urgency Without Pressure

German readers respond to **practical urgency** (speed, convenience) rather than **artificial urgency** (scarcity, FOMO).

**Effective urgency signals:**
- "Sofort per E-Mail" (Instant via email)
- "Direkt einlösbar" (Immediately redeemable)
- "In Sekunden" (In seconds)
- "24/7 verfügbar" (Available 24/7)

**Avoid:**
- "Nur noch heute!" (Only today!)
- "Beeile dich!" (Hurry up!)
- "Limitiertes Angebot" (Limited offer)

## 4. Content Structure Philosophy

### 4.1 The German Reader's Journey

German product page readers typically:

1. **Scan the headline** - Is this what I'm looking for?
2. **Check the price/availability** - Can I get this?
3. **Read the intro** - Quick confirmation this is right
4. **Jump to FAQ** - Specific questions answered
5. **Return to instructions** - How exactly do I do this?

Structure content to support this **non-linear reading pattern**:

- Clear, scannable headings
- Self-contained sections
- FAQ that answers real questions
- Instructions in numbered steps

### 4.2 The "Vorteile" (Benefits) Section

German pages should include a dedicated benefits section. This serves as:

- Quick value summary for scanners
- Trust signals (official partner, instant delivery)
- Differentiation (why dundle vs alternatives)

Present as bullet points, not prose. Each bullet should be a complete, standalone value statement.

### 4.3 Instruction Depth

German readers expect **detailed, practical instructions**.

**English style:**
> "Redeem your code on the platform's website."

**German style:**
> 1. Besuche die Einlöseseite.
> 2. Gib deinen Code ein.
> 3. Bestätige deine Eingabe.
> 4. Fertig! Das Guthaben wurde deinem Konto gutgeschrieben.

The "Fertig!" (Done!) at the end provides psychological closure and confirmation of success.

### 4.4 Multiple Methods = Multiple Sections

If there are multiple ways to accomplish something (App vs Website, Direct vs Account), **always separate them** with clear headers. German readers prefer explicit options over having to figure out which path applies to them.

---

## 5. Cultural & Market Context

### 5.1 Payment Method Priorities

German consumers have distinct payment preferences. When mentioning payment options, prioritise:

1. **PayPal** - Most trusted online payment in Germany
2. **Klarna Sofortüberweisung** - German-specific, widely used
3. **Apple Pay** - Growing rapidly
4. **Handyrechnung** (mobile billing) - Popular for digital goods

Credit cards are less common in Germany than UK/US. Emphasise alternatives.

### 5.2 Security & Privacy Consciousness

German consumers are **particularly privacy-conscious**. Effective reassurance includes:

- "Ohne Bank- oder Kreditkartendaten teilen zu müssen"
- "Sicher und anonym bezahlen"
- "Volle Kostenkontrolle"
- "Keine Weitergabe persönlicher Daten"

This isn't fear-mongering; it's acknowledging a genuine cultural value.

### 5.3 Fee Transparency Expectations

German readers expect **explicit fee information**. Vague statements like "fees may apply" are insufficient.

**Provide:**
- Specific percentages where applicable
- Concrete euro examples when helpful
- When fees apply (conditions, time periods)
- What's included vs extra

This builds trust rather than creating suspicion.

### 5.4 Regional Awareness

German readers need to know:

- Whether products work in Germany/Austria/Switzerland
- If codes or products are region-locked
- Currency implications (EUR vs other)
- Whether German customer service is available

Address regional restrictions proactively, not as an afterthought.

## 6. Content Type Tone Adjustments

Different content types warrant subtle tone shifts:

### 6.1 Payment/Financial Products
**Tone:** Trustworthy, security-focused, slightly more formal
**Emphasis:** Privacy, anonymity, accepted platforms, fee transparency

### 6.2 Gift Products
**Tone:** Friendly, gift-oriented, convenience-focused
**Emphasis:** Flexibility, ease of gifting, recipient experience

### 6.3 Gaming Products
**Tone:** Enthusiastic (within German norms), community-aware
**Emphasis:** What you can do with it, compatibility, value

### 6.4 Technical/Complex Products
**Tone:** Informative, clear about requirements
**Emphasis:** Prerequisites, step-by-step guidance, troubleshooting

---

## 7. FAQ Writing Philosophy

### 7.1 Question Formulation

German FAQs use natural question forms:

- "Wie kann ich...?" (How can I...?)
- "Wie lange ist...?" (How long is...?)
- "Gibt es...?" (Are there...?)
- "Was passiert, wenn...?" (What happens if...?)

Avoid overly formal or robotic question structures.

### 7.2 Answer Style

FAQ answers should:

- Start with a direct answer (Yes/No if applicable)
- Provide necessary context
- Include specific numbers/details
- End with action or resource link if helpful

**Strong answer:**
> **Wie lange ist mein Code gültig?**
> Dein Code ist ab dem Kaufdatum 5 Jahre lang gültig.

**Weak answer:**
> **Wie lange ist mein Code gültig?**
> Die Gültigkeitsdauer variiert. Bitte prüfen Sie die Bedingungen.

### 7.3 German-Market Questions

Include FAQ questions that address German-specific concerns:

- Regional restrictions/currency questions
- German payment method availability
- German customer service availability
- German regulatory context (if relevant)

---

## 8. Handling Edge Cases

### 8.1 When Only English/Foreign Interface Exists

Some platforms don't have German interfaces. Handle by:

- Keeping the original interface terms
- Providing German translation in parentheses: "Redeem" (dt. Einlösen)
- Noting language limitation if significant

### 8.2 When German Term Doesn't Exist

Some English terms are standard even in German contexts. Don't force awkward translations. Use the English term when it's:

- Industry standard in German
- How German users actually search
- Clearer than a translation

### 8.3 When Content Should Differ Significantly

Sometimes the German market genuinely needs different content. This is acceptable when:

- Legal/regulatory requirements differ
- Product features differ by region
- Cultural context requires different emphasis

Don't force English structure onto content that should be fundamentally different.
