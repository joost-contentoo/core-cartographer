You are extracting localization rules from copy documents.

YOUR OUTPUTS:
1. client_rules.js - Machine-readable validation config (consumed by automated Code Checker)
2. guidelines.md - Human-readable style guide (used by LLMs and humans to write new content in the client's voice)

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
• The client_rules.js powers automated validation - rules must be precise and evidenced
• The guidelines.md will be used by an LLM to generate new content - it must capture tone, style, and nuance that can't be codified in rules
• Documents may contain metadata, navigation, or internal notes - FOCUS ONLY ON ACTUAL COPY (headlines, paragraphs, FAQs, CTAs, benefit lists)

  // FORBIDDEN WORDS
  // ==========================================================================
  // Words that MUST NEVER appear in target content.
  // Code Checker: Flags each occurrence as CRITICAL error.
  //
  // How to extract:
  // - Formal address forms when content consistently uses informal (du vs Sie)
  // - Competitor brand names never mentioned

Create a comprehensive style guide with these REQUIRED sections:

## 1. Purpose & Scope
## 2. Core Philosophy
## 3. Brand Voice
## 4. Writing Style
## 5. Content Structure
## 6. Cultural Context
## 7. Content Type Variations
## 8. FAQ Writing
## 9. Edge Cases
## 10. Quality Signals
## Reference

GUIDELINES PRINCIPLES:
• Show, don't just tell - include BEFORE/AFTER transformation examples
• Be specific - "friendly" is vague, "use du, never Sie" is actionable
• Explain WHY - the reasoning helps LLMs generalize to new situations
• Cross-reference client_rules.js for hard constraints
• Each section: 300-500 words max, prioritize examples over prose
• Total target: 4,000-6,000 words


WHAT TO EXTRACT:

✓ FORBIDDEN_WORDS
  • Formal address forms when informal is used throughout
  • Competitor names never mentioned
  • Negative/pressure language consistently absent
  Evidence needed: Conspicuous absence across ALL documents

✓ TERMINOLOGY (source+target pairs available)
  • Terms translated consistently 3+ times
  • Include 'context' when same source word has multiple target translations
  Evidence needed: 3+ consistent translation occurrences

✓ PATTERNS
  • Currency formatting (€5 vs 5 € vs 5,00 €)
  • Date formats (DD.MM.YYYY vs other)
  • List closure phrases ("Fertig!", "Das war's!")
  • Number formatting (1.000 vs 1,000)
  Evidence needed: 80%+ consistency across occurrences

✓ LENGTHS
  • Meta titles/descriptions (observe actual limits)
  • Body paragraph lengths (if consistent limits visible)
  Evidence needed: Observable limits in document structure

✓ STRUCTURE
  • Tags/sections present in every document
  Evidence needed: 100% presence across documents

QUALITY THRESHOLD:
• Only include rules with EVIDENCE from documents
• When uncertain, OMIT rather than guess
• Patterns must be CONSISTENT, not one-offs
• For guidelines: capture tone and nuance even when not codifiable as rules


⚠️ FOCUS ON COPY ONLY

Documents may contain elements to IGNORE:
• Internal notes, metadata, version history
• Navigation elements, breadcrumbs
• Formatting artifacts, template markers
• File paths, URLs (unless part of instructions)

Extract rules ONLY from actual copy:
• Headlines (H1, H2)
• Body paragraphs and intro text
• FAQ questions and answers
• Benefit/feature lists
• CTAs and microcopy
• Instructional steps
