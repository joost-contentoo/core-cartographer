You are extracting localization rules from copy documents.

YOUR OUTPUTS:
1. client_rules.js - Machine-readable validation config (consumed by automated Code Checker)
2. guidelines.md - Human-readable style guide (used by LLMs and humans to write new content in the client's voice)

CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
• client_rules.js = STRICT validation rules. Must be precise, evidenced, codifiable. When uncertain, OMIT.
• guidelines.md = QUALITATIVE style guide. Captures tone, voice, nuance even when not codifiable. Can include observations with moderate confidence.

Respond with:

## SUBTYPE: general

### CLIENT_RULES

```javascript
[Complete client_rules.js following the annotated template above]
```

### GUIDELINES

[Complete guidelines.md following the structure above - NO code fence]


⚠️ FOCUS ON COPY ONLY

Documents may contain elements to IGNORE:
• Internal notes, metadata, version history
• Navigation elements, breadcrumbs
• Formatting artifacts, template markers
• File paths, URLs (unless part of instructions)

Extract rules ONLY from actual copy:
• Headlines (H1, H2)
• Body paragraphs and intro text
• FAQ questions and answers
• Benefit/feature lists
• CTAs and microcopy
• Instructional steps


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXTRACTION RULES & EVIDENCE THRESHOLDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FORBIDDEN_WORDS
  What: Formal address (Sie vs du), competitor names, pressure language
  Evidence: Conspicuous absence across ALL documents


✓ TERMINOLOGY (source+target pairs available)
  Evidence: 3+ occurrences across ALL document text (includes repetitions within docs)
  Include 'context' field when same source has multiple valid targets

PATTERNS
  What: Currency (€5 vs 5 €), dates (DD.MM vs DD/MM), list endings, numbers
  Evidence: 80%+ consistency across occurrences

LENGTHS
  What: Meta titles/descriptions, paragraph/FAQ lengths
  Evidence: Observable limits in document structure

STRUCTURE
  What: Required tags/sections
  Evidence: 100% presence across documents

CLIENT_RULES.JS QUALITY STANDARD:
→ Every rule needs EVIDENCE from documents
→ Uncertain? OMIT from client_rules.js (strict validation requires precision)
→ Patterns must be CONSISTENT, not one-offs

GUIDELINES.MD QUALITY STANDARD:
→ Capture tone, voice, style even if not codifiable
→ Can include observations with moderate confidence
→ Explain WHY for each guideline (helps LLMs generalize)

# Translation Guidelines for [CLIENT_NAME]

> **Purpose**: This guide enables writers and LLMs to create [TARGET_LANGUAGE] content that matches [CLIENT_NAME]'s brand voice, style, and cultural expectations.

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**What this covers**: [TARGET_LANGUAGE] localization for [CLIENT_NAME]'s [content types: product pages, marketing, FAQs, etc.].

**Key principle**: [TARGET_LANGUAGE] content is an **adaptation**, not direct translation. Restructure, expand, or condense based on target audience expectations.

**Typical approach**:
- **Restructure** for scannability and directness
- **Expand** where target audience expects detail (fees, steps, guarantees)
- **Condense** where source is verbose
- **Adapt tone** to match target market norms

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

### Localization vs Translation

[Describe the client's philosophy - is it transcreation? Direct but adapted? Culturally sensitive? Example:]

**English (promotional style)**:
> [Example from source documents]

**[Target Language] (adapted approach)**:
> [How it should be adapted and why]

**What changed**: [Explain 2-3 key transformations: tone shift, structure change, detail level adjustment]

---

## 3. Brand Voice

### Tone Profile

[CLIENT_NAME] speaks as [persona: knowledgeable friend / authoritative expert / playful guide / etc.]:

| Quality | How to Express |
|---------|----------------|
| **[Quality 1]** | [How to achieve this - be specific] |
| **[Quality 2]** | [How to achieve this - be specific] |
| **[Quality 3]** | [How to achieve this - be specific] |

### Emotional Register

[Target language] [industry/domain] copy is **[pragmatic/enthusiastic/formal/casual]**, not **[opposite]**.

**Avoid**:
- [Specific phrases or tones to avoid, with examples]
- [e.g., "Excessive enthusiasm: 'Amazing!', 'Incredible!'"]

**Instead, convey value through**:
- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]
- [Alternative approach 3]

### Voice Examples

| Situation | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| [Context 1] | "[Bad example]" | "[Good example]" |
| [Context 2] | "[Bad example]" | "[Good example]" |
| [Context 3] | "[Bad example]" | "[Good example]" |

---

## 4. Writing Style

### Address Form

[CLIENT_NAME] uses **[formal/informal]** address throughout all [TARGET_LANGUAGE] content.

[If applicable: Explain reasoning - creates approachability, matches audience expectations, aligns with market conventions]

**Rule**: [Specific grammar rule, e.g., "Never mix du and Sie", "Always use usted in Mexican Spanish", "Use tu not vous for French millennials"]

**Correct**: "[Example sentence]"
**Wrong**: "[Example with mixed address or wrong form]"

### Sentence Structure

- **Length**: [Preference - short and punchy? Detailed and flowing?]
- **Complexity**: [Simple or sophisticated?]
- **Active vs Passive**: [Preference and when]

**Examples**:
- ✅ "[Good example]"
- ❌ "[What to avoid]"

### Punctuation & Formatting

[Key punctuation rules for target language:]
- [Rule 1: e.g., "Use spaces before colons in French: « Voici : »"]
- [Rule 2: e.g., "Use guillemets not quotes: « » not " ""]
- [Rule 3: e.g., "Exclamation marks are rare - only for genuine excitement"]

---

## 5. Content Structure

### Scannability

[How should content be structured for the target audience?]

**Principles**:
- [Principle 1: e.g., "Lead with benefits, not features"]
- [Principle 2: e.g., "Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)"]
- [Principle 3: e.g., "Bullet lists for 3+ items"]

### Headlines

**Style**: [Descriptive, Question-based, Command form, etc.]

**Examples**:
- H1: "[Example main headline]"
- H2: "[Example subheading]"

**Formula**: [If there's a pattern, describe it]

### Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

**Tone**: [Direct command / Friendly invitation / Urgent / Casual]

**Common patterns**:
- "[CTA example 1]" → [When to use]
- "[CTA example 2]" → [When to use]
- "[CTA example 3]" → [When to use]

---

## 6. Cultural Context

### Target Market: [Specify region/country]

**Cultural Considerations**:
- [Cultural factor 1 and how it affects copy]
- [Cultural factor 2 and how it affects copy]
- [Cultural factor 3 and how it affects copy]

**Localized Adaptations**:
- **Units**: [e.g., Convert imperial to metric for EU markets]
- **Dates**: [Format preference from patterns section]
- **Currency**: [Format and symbol placement from patterns section]
- **Holidays**: [Reference local holidays if relevant]
- **Payment methods**: [Mention local options like iDEAL, Boleto, etc.]

### What Resonates vs What Doesn't

| ✅ Resonates | ❌ Doesn't Resonate |
|-------------|-------------------|
| [Cultural value/approach 1] | [What to avoid 1] |
| [Cultural value/approach 2] | [What to avoid 2] |
| [Cultural value/approach 3] | [What to avoid 3] |

---

## 7. Content Type Variations

### Product Descriptions

**Structure**: [How to organize - features first? Benefits first? Story-based?]

**Length**: [From lengths section - typical paragraph/description length]

**Key elements to always include**:
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]

**Example transformation**:

**Before (English)**:
```
[Source text example]
```

**After ([Target Language])**:
```
[Adapted text example]
```

**Changes made**: [List 2-3 key adaptations]

### Marketing Content

**Approach**: [Transcreate vs translate? How much freedom?]

**Priorities**:
1. [Priority 1 - e.g., Emotional impact over literal accuracy]
2. [Priority 2 - e.g., Local cultural references over English idioms]
3. [Priority 3 - e.g., Compliance with local advertising regulations]

### Instructional Content

**Style**: [Concise steps? Detailed explanations? Friendly guidance?]

**Structure pattern**:
1. [Step format - numbered? Bullet? How to phrase]
2. [Typical length per step]
3. [Closure phrase - if any from patterns section]

**Example**:
```
[Show a 3-step instruction in target language style]
```

---

## 8. FAQ Writing

### Question Format

**Style**: [Direct question? "How do I..." vs "How to..." vs statement]

**Examples**:
- ✅ "[Good FAQ question format]"
- ❌ "[Avoid this format]"

### Answer Structure

**Approach**: [Get to the point immediately vs provide context first]

**Length**: [From lengths section - typical FAQ answer length]

**Pattern**:
1. [Direct answer first / Context first / Other approach]
2. [Additional details if needed]
3. [Link to more info if applicable]

**Example Q&A**:

**Q**: "[Example FAQ question]"

**A**: "[Example FAQ answer showing structure]"

---

## 9. Edge Cases

### Special Characters & Symbols

[How to handle:]
- Emoji: [Use sparingly? Never? Specific contexts?]
- Currency symbols: [From patterns section]
- Trademark symbols: [™, ®, © - when and how]

### Numbers & Data

**Formatting**:
- Thousands: [1,000 vs 1.000 vs 1 000]
- Decimals: [1.5 vs 1,5]
- Percentages: [15% vs 15 %]
- Ranges: [5-10 vs 5–10 vs 5 to 10]

### Names & Brands

**Product names**: [Translate? Keep English? Mixed?]
**Brand names**: [Never translate? Transliterate? Add explanation?]
**Person names**: [Keep original? Localize common names?]

**Examples**:
- "[English product name]" → "[How to handle in target language]"

---

## 10. Quality Signals

### What "Good" Looks Like

**Linguistic quality**:
- [ ] Grammatically perfect (no errors)
- [ ] Natural flow (sounds native)
- [ ] Consistent terminology (from client_rules.js)
- [ ] Appropriate register (matches brand voice)

**Content quality**:
- [ ] Accurate (conveys correct information)
- [ ] Complete (no missing elements)
- [ ] Scannable (easy to skim)
- [ ] Actionable (clear next steps)

### Red Flags to Check

Before finalizing, check for these issues:
- ❌ [Common error 1 for this language/client]
- ❌ [Common error 2 for this language/client]
- ❌ [Common error 3 for this language/client]

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] Does this sound like [CLIENT_NAME]'s voice?
- [ ] Would a native [TARGET_LANGUAGE] speaker write this way?
- [ ] Are all client_rules.js constraints met?
- [ ] Does it achieve the same goal as the source?
- [ ] Is it the right length for the context?

---

## Reference

### Key Terms Cross-Reference

For exact terminology translations, always consult:
→ **client_rules.js** `terminology` section (required translations)

### Critical Constraints

From client_rules.js that MUST be followed:
- **Forbidden words**: [List or reference client_rules.js]
- **Required patterns**: [Currency, dates, etc. - reference client_rules.js]
- **Length limits**: [Meta tags, etc. - reference client_rules.js]

### Further Reading

[If applicable, list resources:]
- [Style guide URL]
- [Brand guidelines URL]
- [Language authority reference]

---

## Usage Notes for LLMs

When generating new content:

1. **Start with WHY**: Understand the purpose before writing
2. **Reference examples**: Use the transformations above as models
3. **Apply systematically**: Go through checklist for each piece
4. **Prioritize clarity**: When in doubt, be clearer rather than fancier
5. **Check client_rules.js**: Validate against forbidden words, terminology, patterns
6. **Read aloud**: If it sounds unnatural to a native speaker, revise

**Remember**: These guidelines capture patterns observed in [CLIENT_NAME]'s existing content. When making trade-offs, favor consistency with these established patterns over general best practices.

```

CRITICAL: Replace all placeholders ([CLIENT_NAME], [TARGET_LANGUAGE], etc.) with actual values from the documents you're analyzing.

Häufig gestellte Fragen zum Xbox-Guthaben

Auf welchen Geräten kann ich diese Xbox-Karte einlösen?

Dein Xbox-Guthaben kannst du auf Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S sowie im Microsoft Store auf PC oder Smartphone einlösen.

Funktionieren Xbox-Karten noch auf der Xbox 360?

Nein, der Xbox 360 Store und Xbox 360 Marketplace wurden am 29. Juli 2024 offiziell geschlossen – dementsprechend sind Guthabencodes leider nicht mehr auf der Xbox 360 einlösbar. 

Wie lange ist eine Xbox-Guthabenkarte gültig?

Xbox-Guthabenkarten sind unbefristet gültig und laufen somit nicht ab.

Gibt es regionale Einschränkungen bei der Verwendung von Xbox-Aufladekarten?

Ja, Xbox-Aufladekarten sind an die Region und an die Währung gebunden, für die sie gekauft wurden. Beim Kauf einer digitalen Karte solltest du also sicherstellen, dass du die Karte für das Land wählst, mit dem auch dein Microsoft-Konto verknüpft ist. Weitere Informationen findest du in den Geschäftsbedingungen für Microsoft-Geschenkkarten.

Wofür kann man Xbox-Guthaben verwenden?

Mit Xbox-Guthaben hast du die freie Wahl aus sowohl digitalen als auch physischen Produkten im Microsoft Store, wie z.B.:

Sind Microsoft- und Xbox-Guthabenkarten dasselbe?

Ja, Xbox-Guthabenkarten sind im Grunde Microsoft-Guthabenkarten. Die Geschenkkarten können direkt als Zahlungsmittel im Xbox Store, Windows Store bzw. Microsoft Store verwendet werden. Das bedeutet im Übrigen auch, dass du mit einer Microsoft-Geschenkkarte dein Xbox One oder Xbox Series X|S-Guthaben aufladen kannst, denn von deinem Microsoft-Konto aus verwaltest du ebenfalls deine Xbox-Spiele und -Abos.
